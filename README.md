# **Time Serie, Investment and Credit Risk Modeling**  

In this repository, we introduce and demonstrate the application of some of the most widely used techniques in time series analysis, investment portfolio optimization, investment risk and credit risk modeling. These methods are essential for anyone working in quantitative finance, data science, or economics, and they allow for deeper insights into financial data, risk assessment, and forecasting.
